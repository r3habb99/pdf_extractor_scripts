================================================================================

üèÜ WINNER: PYTHON

REASONING:
1. ACCURACY IS PARAMOUNT: Your 90%+ accuracy goal is best achieved with Python
2. CURRENT SUCCESS: You're already succeeding with Python implementation
3. FUTURE-PROOF: AI/ML innovations happen in Python ecosystem first
4. SPECIALIZED LIBRARIES: Unmatched for document processing
5. INVESTMENT PROTECTION: Your current codebase and knowledge

WHEN TO CHOOSE NODE.JS:
- Building web interfaces (but FastAPI/Flask work great with Python)
- Pure speed more important than accuracy
- Team primarily JavaScript developers
- Simple document viewing (not complex processing)
- Microservices architecture with other Node.js services

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY (STAY WITH PYTHON):
Instead of switching, optimize your current Python implementation:

1. Performance Improvements:
   - Use multiprocessing for CPU-bound OCR tasks
   - Implement asyncio for I/O operations
   - Add caching for repeated operations
   - Use Cython for critical performance paths

2. Modern Python Features:
   - Python 3.11+ for performance improvements
   - Type hints for better code quality
   - Dataclasses for structured data
   - Context managers for resource handling

3. Deployment Optimization:
   - Multi-stage Docker builds
   - Optimize dependencies with pip-tools
   - Use virtual environments properly
   - Implement proper logging and monitoring

CONCLUSION:
For your PDF invoice processing system, Python is the clear winner due to its
superior accuracy potential, extensive ecosystem, and long-term viability in
the document AI space. Continue optimizing your Python implementation rather
than rewriting in Node.js.
